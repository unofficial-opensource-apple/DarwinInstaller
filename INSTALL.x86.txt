Installation Instructions for OpenDarwin/x86 (July 19, 2004)
============================================================

Supported Hardware
==================

IDE:
  PIIX4 IDE controllers have been found to work.
  VIA VT82xx IDE chipsets
  Attached devices must be UDMA/33 compatible or better.
Ethernet:
  Intel 8255x 10/100 ethernet controllers are supported.
    3Com 905cXXX based ethernet controllers are supported.
  DEC Tulip based ethernet controllers are supported.
     - ADMtek 981, 983, 985
     - PNIC 82c168
     - DEC 21143
     - preliminary support for PNIC2 and DEC 21140
Video:
  You must have a VESA 2.0 compliant video card.  Almost all
  modern graphics cards are VESA 2.0 compliant.  However, emulators
  such as vmware do not have VESA 2.0 compliant emulated video cards.
Successfully tested hardware:
  All 440BX motherboards tested have worked with their internal
  IDE controllers.
  IBM ThinkPad A21m (with onboard Intel ethernet)
  MSI K8T Neo motherboard with Athlon64 3200+

See http://www.opendarwin.org/hardware/ for a community-created
site with hardware that has been found to work.

At least 128 MB RAM is needed.

Installation Instructions
=========================

To install OpenDarwin/x86, you must retrieve the installation CD image from
http://www.opendarwin.org/downloads/.  After getting the CD image, you'll
need to write that image to a CDROM.  The installation image is a bootable
El-Torito ISO disk image.

When preparing your system to install OpenDarwin/x86, it is a good idea to
disconnect all hard drives other than the target disk.  This is to prevent
the accidental destruction of data on the wrong disk.

After getting the installation CD, and your machine prepared to install
OpenDarwin/x86, insert the installation CD into an IDE CDROM drive and turn
the machine on.

When booting off the CDROM, the first screen you'll see is a bootloader
prompt.  You should not need to enter any flags to the bootloader, so
either press enter to continue, or wait 10 seconds and the boot process
will continue automatically.
After the boot process continues, you will see diagnostic output from the
kernel, and you will end up at an installation prompt. If you just see a
white background with the Apple logo, add "-v" as a boot argument. The
installation prompt will list the devices it found to potentially install
OpenDarwin/x86 onto:

The following devices are available for installation:
1. [ Vendor String ] /dev/disk0 [ size ]
2. [ Vendor String ] /dev/disk1 [ size ]
Which device would you like to install Darwin onto?

At this prompt enter the disk you wish to install OpenDarwin onto (the
number of the disk to install onto; 1 for /dev/disk0, 2 for /dev/disk1).
You can also enter "shell" at this prompt and it will drop you into an
emergency shell.

After entering the disk you wish to install OpenDarwin/x86 onto, the install
script will give you the following prompt:
1) Auto-partition the disk (Destroys all disk contents)
2) Manually partition the disk using fdisk
Choice:

If your disk is already partitioned, you will get a third option:
3) Use existing partitions

The first option (Auto-partition) will destroy the contents of the disk,
and create one large partition containing an Apple UFS filesystem. This is
the preferred option.

The second option (Manually partition) will run the OpenDarwin/x86 fdisk.
Use this only if you know which partition scheme you want. This option can
also destroy all contents of the selected disk. If you choose this option,
you must create at least one Apple UFS partition with a size of at least
900MB.

The third option will let you install OpenDarwin/x86 onto an already
existing partition.  Make sure you already have the partitions from option
2 set up.  In particular, you must have a UFS parition; OpenDarwin/x86
7.2.1 will not boot from a HFS+ partition . The install script will ask you
which partition you want to use. The contents of this partition will be
destroyed.

The install script then will create a new filesystem on this partition and
will start to install OpenDarwin on this partition.

When the install script is finished extracting the packages onto the disk
it will prompt for the root password. You then have the choice whether to
do further configuration of the system or not. Further configuration offers
such things as adding more users.

Once done with the configuration there is the option of rebooting or
spawning a shell. Unless you have post-install things you wish to do, you
should reboot the system and remove the install CD from the CDROM drive.

Once your machine has booted OpenDarwin, it waits for your first login.
Login as 'root', with the password set during the install.

Known Issues
============

* The booter won't automatically use the OpenDarwin UFS partition as the
  root disk. You have to pass the "rd=" parameter to the kernel. On a lot
  of installs the parameter to be passed is:
  rd=disk0s1
  However this depends on your local setup. Once booted you can hardwire
  this kernel argument in the file:
  /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist

* IDE drives may not work on x86.  If you have specfied the proper
  partition, and you still see "waiting for root device", then you
  probably have an unsupported IDE device.  Try it, if it doesn't work,
  it's a known problem.

* Video cards must support VESA 2.0 framebuffer modes on x86.
  Try it, if your console looks weird, or doesn't appear, it's a
  known problem.

* ssh is not enabled by default.  To enable it, edit /etc/xinetd.d/ssh and
  change the line which says "disable = yes" to "disable = no" and restart
  xinetd with "killall -HUP xinetd" or
  "/usr/sbin/xinetd -pidfile /var/run/xinetd.pid"

* X11 is not installed by default.   We had to remove it from the standard
  distribution due to space constraints. You can download either the X
  tarball at http://www.opendarwin.org/downloads/7.2.1/X11-x86.tar.bz2 or
  X11 rpm at
  http://www.opendarwin.org/downloads/7.2.1/org.opendarwin.X11-7.2.1-1.i386.rpm
  separately and install it.
