Installation Instructions for Darwin/ppc (April 29, 2005)
============================================================

Supported Hardware
==================

Darwin/ppc 8.0.1 will install and boot on all PowerPC-based
Macintoshes supported by Mac OS X 10.4.

Some functionality like the PMU and low-level hardware support works
only by using binary drivers distributed by Apple on the installation CD.

At least 128 MB RAM are needed.


Installation Instructions
=========================

0) Get the CD image from http://www.opendarwin.org/downloads/

1) The .iso image is gzipped. Use 'gunzip' or StuffIt Expander to
   extract the image.

2) Burn the CD image to CD.
	If you have an OS X system with a CD burner, you can burn the CD image
	using Disk Copy.  Select Image->Burn Image from the menu bar.
	If you have a OpenDarwin, *BSD or Linux system with a CD burner, you 
   	can burn the CD image using cdrecord.  See the cdrecord man page for 
   	information.

3) Boot from the CD image.
	Insert the CD image into the CDROM drive, and reboot.  Hold down the
	'c' key while rebooting to boot off the CD.

	When the machine boots off the CD, you will see a screen with a black
	background and white text.  Much text will scroll by, and you will
	eventually be prompted for installation questions.

4) Select the disk to install onto.
	When the CD has finished booting, you will be prompted with the
	following question:
	The following devices are available for installation:
	1. <disk id string> @ disk1 (<size>)
	Which device would you like to install Darwin onto? 

	Enter the number (on the far left) of the device you'd like
	to install Darwin on.

	At this point you can also enter the word "shell" to enter
	an emergency shell.  This should not be needed for normal
	installation.

5) Select the partition to install onto.
	After selecting the disk to install into, you must choose a partition.
	You will be prompted as follows:
	Which partition would you like to install into:
	1) /dev/disk1s1 Apple_partition_map Apple
	2) /dev/disk1s2 Apple_Driver_ATA Macintosh
	3) /dev/disk1s3 Apple_Driver_ATA Macintosh
	4) /dev/disk1s4 Apple_Driver_IOKit Macintosh
	5) /dev/disk1s5 Apple_Patches Patch Partition
	6) /dev/disk1s6 Apple_HFS untitled
	7) /dev/disk1s7 Apple_HFS untitled 2
	Your Choice:

	The choices are displayed in the form of 
	#) <device name> <partition type> <partition name>
	You should choose the partition you want to install into.
	You should never choose partitions of type other than Apple_HFS unless
	you know what you're doing.  

6) Do you want the partition erased or not?
	The install script will prompt you for whether you want to do a
	clean install or not.  Answering "yes" will newfs_hfs the partition
	and begin installing Darwin.
	If you choose "no" here, the partition will not be newfs'd but
	the installer will begin extracting files over the top of whatever
	is on the disk.  Doing a clean install is the recommended method.

7) Wait.
	After choosing the partition to install onto, the installer will
	automatically create a new filesystem on that partition (HFS, and
	it will destroy all existing data on that partition), and install
	OpenDarwin onto it. The install script will also run bless to make 
   	the partition bootable.

8) Setting the root password.
    The installer is now done installing files on the target filesystem and
    prompts for the root password. 

9) Further configration.
    Now there is the option to do further configuration of the system (like
    adding more users) or finishing up.

8) Finishing up. 
	After installing all the packages onto the partition, the installer
	will prompt you to reboot the machine.  At this point, if there are
	any last minute changes you would like to make, the installer also
	provides the option of spawning a shell.

9) Login.
    Once your machine has booted OpenDarwin, it waits for your first
    login. Login as 'root', with the password set during install.
